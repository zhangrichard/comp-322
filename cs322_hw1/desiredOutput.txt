Golden ratio's continued fraction is: [1; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,...]
You just created [16; 2, 77, 40, 12071]
..and its approximation is 1235022780/74864497
The continued fraction of the above approximation is [16; 2, 77, 40, 12071]
[1; 3, 2, 1, 3, 5, 2, 3, 5, 2, 3, 5, 2, 3, 5, 2, 3, 5, 2, 3,...]
